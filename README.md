## Model overview

a quick glance of the use case of undercover attack on images and texts:
example_images.ipynb and example_texts.ipynb

benign example criterion:  1.1444092e-05;
 
adversarial example criterion:  2.758562

split criterion in our experiment is 1.2505696; 1.1444092e-05 < 1.2505696 --> example1 is judged as a normal example; 2.757648 > 1.2505696 --> example2 is judged as a adversarial example;
